 This is the lecture notes of the topic courses in probability theory, taught by Prof. Victor H de la Pe単a.

 Prof. de la Pe単a is a professor in the Department of Statistics, Columbia University in the City of New York.

 The main topics contain decoupling, self-normalization, (concentration) inequalities, and their applications in several fields including stochastic processes, optimization, and machine learning. 

 We design the series of notes primarily for PhD students at the Georgia Institute of Technology, and we welcome citations and communications.
